# Rails Blog: Signing in using Omniauth

This is the sixth iteration of our Blog App.

<em>Before anything</em>, note that when you generate models, controllers, etc, be sure to include this option, so that it skips tests (which we already have): `--no-test-framework`

In our last iteration, we used Sessions and built our own log in system. Next, we're going to refactor that and create a log in system using OmniAuth. A user should be able to log in / sign up using their Github account. Omniauth allows us to pass user authentication to a third party (like Facebook, Twitter, or Github) instead of having to save a user's login credentials on our database.

1. The [omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and [omniauth-github](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-github) gems are in the Gemfile. Be sure to read the readmes for both.

##Registering our App

2. Before we do anything, we should register our app with Github, which will generate a `client id` and `client secret`, two strings that will let our application talk to Github via OAuth. Register your app [here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) in your Github settings. Be sure to provide a callback URL, which will be a route/method on your controller that you'll be building out to make your user authorization call to Github.

##Figaro

3. We do not want our client_id and client_secret available for everyone to see in our codebase, yet it's information that is necessary for our app to work. One way we can handle this is through [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).

4. Run `figaro install` (make sure you run `bundle install` first). This creates the `config/application.yml` file and adds it to the .gitignore. Add your client_id and client_secret to this file.

##Setting up OmniAuth

5. In `initializers`, create a file called `omniauth.rb` which will include the `OmniAuth::Builder` class as middleware to our application. Omniauth can provide authentication via multiple providers (like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Github). In this case, we're only going to use Github.

Here's an example of how this should look, from the Omniauth gem README:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :twitter, ENV['TWITTER_KEY'], ENV['TWITTER_SECRET']
end
```

##Routes

6. Next, we need to build a route that will redirect users to `/auth/:provider` (provider being declared in `omniauth.rb`).

7. Once a user is authenticated, Omniauth sets a special hash. In order to get back that data, we need to set up an endpoint that matches the callback URL (which we set up when we registered our application on Github) which will be handled by `sessions#create`. Read the [Omniauth gem README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to learn more.

##Changing our Users Table

1. Before, our app had a column for a password digest, which held a users encrypted password. We're going to remove that column (and email) and instead store the following, which comes back in the hash via the omniauth callback we set up: uid, name, and provider (all strings). These are required for authorization; read the [Auth Hash Schema](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema).

##Users Controller

The users controller will no longer be handling the creation of a new user, but instead the sessions controller will handle either finding a user or creating a new one.

##User Model

Our user model should have a class method that given the auth hash as a parameter, should create a new instance of a user, setting the uid, name and provider with data from the auth hash. This method will then be called within our sessions controller create method.

##Sessions Controller

We will need to refactor our sessions controller to include methods to handle our omniauth request and response. The create method will take care of this. It should `find_by_provider_and_uid` (both would be saved in the database if the user exists), or call the method we wrote in our user model. Be sure to set the session as well.

We should also have a destroy method that clears the session when the user logs out.

##Views

Changes various views to display links to logging in via Github, using our `current_user` helper method to check if the user is signed in or not. Display the user's name in the header.
